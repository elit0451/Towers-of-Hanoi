# Towers of Hanoi :tokyo_tower::tokyo_tower::tokyo_tower:

This repository provides an implementation based on the subject of **Sequences** and **Recursion**. You can keep track of the moving disks :dvd: by the visual (text-based) recursive version of the Towers of Hanoi.

## Overview :eyes:
When runnning the [Main.java](https://github.com/elit0451/Towers-of-Hanoi/blob/master/src/Main.java) you will be provided with text-based presentation, where you would be able to observe where each disk moves in every itteration :arrows_counterclockwise:.

<details><summary>Example</summary> 

```java
	ITERATION 1

Tower 1:

Tower 2:

Tower 3:

	ITERATION 2

Tower 1:

Tower 2:

Tower 3:

	ITERATION 3

	ITERATION 6

Tower 3:

	ITERATION 7

Tower 3:

```
</details>

On the example above you can see the process of moving 3 disks from **Tower 1** to **Tower 3**, :one: being the smallest and :three: being the biggest disk.

</br>

> If you want to see a solution with more disks you just need to change the parameter passed when initiating a [Tower](https://github.com/elit0451/Towers-of-Hanoi/blob/1a76651c5b705ffd333aa5afd1a47216c6c1d226/src/Main.java#L10).
